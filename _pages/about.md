My name is Kuat Telegenov. I graduated from the University of Technology Malaysia in 2012 with a bachelors degree in Aeronautics Engineering. After graduation, I joined the robotics lab at Nazarbayev University and completed my master's degree in Mechanics from Eurasian National University in 2014. I worked on projects related to gripper design and taught courses in Mechanical Design. Later, I joined the Robotics Lab at KAUST, where I spent seven years working on robotics projects including aerial and underwater autonomous robots, and in 2025 joined Amazon as a Systems Development Engineer.

I enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors, playing soccer, reading books, and spending time with my family.
