Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share my journey and insights in the world of personal development, programming and robotics.

## About Me

I'm a passionate engineer currently working at Amazon as a Systems Development Engineer. I previously worked at KAUST's Robotics Intelligent Systems and Control Lab ([RISC Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/risclab)). My career in this field started at Nazarbayev University's [Department of Robotics](https://research.nu.edu.kz/en/organisations/department-of-robotics).

## My Expertise

I have worked on different projects including underwater robots for monitoring coral reefs, building and programming autonomous drones, and working on remotely operated vehicles. I have implemented control theories in practice, have extensive experience in 3D modeling, and additive manufacturing. I'm experienced in using different programming languages and frameworks, such as Python and ROS2.

## Continuous Learning

I believe in always learning more. I've earned certifications in areas such as aerial robotics, self-driving cars, deep learning, and many more from online platforms. I am currently working toward my MBA degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

## Leadership

I've taken on leadership roles, like leading teams in international robotics competitions and managing a research lab. I've also published several research papers in different fields of robotics.

## What's Next?

Through this website, I plan to share my journey and experiences, insights, and book reviews of books I recently read. I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
